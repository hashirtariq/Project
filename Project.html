          Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education
          and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly
          assists in curriculum development, accreditation and in the financing
          of research and development. Article 25-A of Constitution of Pakistan
          obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education
          to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide
          free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to
          sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law"

          The education system in Pakistan is generally divided into six levels:
          preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (grades one through
          five), middle (grades six through eight), high (grades nine and ten,
          leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate
          (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School
          Certificate or HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate
          and graduate degrees. The Higher Education Commission established in
          2002 is responsible for all universities and degree awarding
          institutes. It was established in 2002 with Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS
          as its Founding Chairman.

          The literacy rate ranges from 82% in Islamabad to 23% in the Torghar
          District.[8] Literacy rates vary by gender and region. In tribal areas
          female literacy is 9.5%, while Azad Kashmir has a literacy rate of
          74%. Pakistan produces about 445,000 university graduates and 10,000
          computer science graduates per year. Despite these statistics,
          Pakistan still has low literacy rate. And Pakistan also has the second
          largest out of school population (22.8 million children) after
          Nigeria..
